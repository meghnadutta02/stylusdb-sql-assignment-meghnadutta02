## Step 20: Publish Your Package to NPM

- Add a Shebang Line: Ensure the first line of your cli.js file starts with a shebang line that specifies the path to the Node.js interpreter. This line is crucial for letting the system know that the script should be run with Node.js.
- Make sure everything is perfect on the package.json. See the additional commands added for CLI to work. Test this locally with `npm link` and running the command.
- _Update the Version_: Update the version in package.json.
- _Create an npm Account_: If you don't have an npm account, create one at npmjs.com.
- _Update the Readme_: Update the Readme to include the commands that you would want to show up on npmjs.com.
- _Login to npm_: In your terminal, log in to npm using npm login and enter your credentials.
- _Publish the Package_:
  - Run `npm publish` in your project directory.
  - Ensure there are no errors in the output, and your package should now be live on npm.
- _Verify Publication_:
  - Check your package on the npm website - https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylusdb-sql.
  - Try installing it in a separate project using `npm install stylusdb-sql`
